We propose a Probability-Driven Framework (PDF) for open world semantic segmentation that includes (i) a lightweight U-decoder branch to identify unknown classes by estimating uncertainties, (ii) a pseudo-labeling scheme to generate ground truth for unknown classes, and (iii) an incremental knowledge distillation strategy to incorporate novel classes.
